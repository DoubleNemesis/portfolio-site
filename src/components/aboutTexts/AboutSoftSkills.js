            <p>
                As well as being a qualified English teacher, I have a Masters’ degree in Creative Writing and have spent many happy hours creating teaching resources and writing exams, as well as other written-word projects both on and offline.
                As a colleague, I’m known as a peace-maker and negotiator. Work-place happiness is extremely important to me and the well-being of my colleagues is paramount as we take on the pressures of work together.
