                I’m always learning. Wtih JavaScript and React, there will always be something new in the pipeline and new coding patterns.
                I’m also learning the ropes of Gatsby and expanding my back-end knowledge with PHP (with a special focus on Wordpress) and NodeJS.

                For styling, I’ve stuck to vanilla CSS. Frameworks come and go and I believe it’s best to know what’s going on under the hood.
                That said, I will probably add a CSS framework to my skillset in the near future..
